# Blackjack

## Features
* Recreated the game of Blackjack in Java and designed the user interface of the game using JavaFX.
* Allowed the player to place bets and play against an AI until they run out of money. 
* Processed images for cards to be displayed on the game GUI.
* Designed a wireframe that involved 3 scenes: one for rules and setting starting money, one for setting bets, and the last for playing the game.
* Amended initial design to change border panes instead of scenes after scenes would cause the information to be lost between scene switches.
* Improved upon the quality of the game by adding pause transitions to make the game flow better.
* Involved in object-oriented programming to make card objects for both the dealer and player.
