**Blackjack**

Recreated the game of Blackjack in Java and designed the user interface of the game using JavaFX.
Allowed the player to place bets and play against an AI until they run out of money. 
Processed images for cards to be displayed on the game GUI.
Designed a wireframe that involved 3 scenes: one for rules and setting starting money, one for setting bets, and the last for playing the game.
Amended initial design to change border panes instead of scenes after scenes would cause the information to be lost between scene switches.
Improved upon the quality of the game by adding pause transitions to make the game flow better.
Involved in object-oriented programming to make card objects for both the dealer and player.
